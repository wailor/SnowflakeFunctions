# SnowflakeFunctions
Snowflake Functions categorized with definitions

This file contains a list of the Snowflake functions I could retrieve as of October 2024 which were run through ChatGPT to provide a sample of how the SQL function used be used in a SQL statement  and provide some extra comments about it. This was more of an experiment to test ChatGPT o1-previews capability to understand each command.

I will say it did go off track for a bit as it started adding other SQL commands not contained in the list so extra prompting was required to constrain the results only to functions provided.
